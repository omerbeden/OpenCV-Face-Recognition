#Face Recognition

I've been tried to implement openCV so that recognition and identification faces.
You might think that openCV is getting old day by day according to their frameworks and libraries but I just wanted to try this library and see what goes on in that area.

Before I start the coding , after the search , I found a youtube video which teach face recognition using openCV
you can watch that video here is link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmZ29Vta7Vc
