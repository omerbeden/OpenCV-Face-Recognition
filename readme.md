# Face Recognition

I've been tried to implement __openCV__ so that __recognition and identification the faces__.
You might think that openCV is getting old day by day according to their frameworks and libraries but I just wanted to try this library and see what goes on in that area.

Before I start the coding , after the search , I found a __youtube video__ which teach face recognition using openCV
you can watch that video here is link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmZ29Vta7Vc

I need to warm you that this implementation is not giving perfect recognition. However, this recognition can be improved setting different things.
